- We will gain control over these as part of the ember-a11y org soon.

### Logo

- Mel created us a logo!
- We'll use it until we're an official subteam and get the script version.

### Demo App

- Basic structure online [https://ember-a11y.github.io/a11y-demo-app/](https://ember-a11y.github.io/a11y-demo-app/)
- Working through list in [design doc](https://usecanvas.com/ember-a11y/a11y-demo-app/4Tc35ruHgwbZCX1WRI3anp).
- DOM structure is important, we can't just throw the components on a page.
  - For now defer to patterns that Melanie is familiar with.
  - Will do active research into markup after focus on fixing glaring Ember issues.
  - Provide lots of examples.

### Collection of a11y tools

- We can totally steal some of approaches from other tools.
  - https://github.com/prettydiff/a11y-tools
  - https://twitter.com/burgessdryan/status/724384501326045184?s=09
  - http://a11yproject.com/
- We'll review each of these and regroup on things we should use or port to Ember.

### Colour Blindness Testing Idea

- Ben thinking of making an Ember addon to simulate colour blindness.
- "Shared Experience" testing.
- [App for OS X.](https://michelf.ca/projects/sim-daltonism/)
- [This helps determine ADA compliance levels.](http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html#fg=33FF33,bg=333333)

### Compliance rules for countries that aren't USA

- Melanie to share information on that once they've compiled it.
- [Worldwide disability discrimination acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_discrimination_act)
